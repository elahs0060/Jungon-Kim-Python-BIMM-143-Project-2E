Scientific Question: How does umami taste receptor gene T1R1 affect the carnivorous specie panda to have herbivrous dietary feature?
Scientific Hypothesis: If ORF of umami taste receptor gene T1R1 that allows other carnivores such as human, mouse, or chicken to taste savoriness of the meat does not function in the Panda's genome sequence then Panda will not have an appetite-reward system on meet and choose bamboo for their appetite due to more release of hormone that makes panda choose bamboo instead.
What is needed to run the code:

1. the jupyter notebook
2. the FASTA files for T1R1 Panda
3. the FASTA files for T1R1 Human
4. the FASTA files for T1R1 Mouse
5. the FASTA files for T1R1 Rat
6. the FASTA files for T1R1 Dog
7. the FASTA files for T1R1 Cat
8. pymol is needed to part 2

Information about where FASTA file was found: T1R1 Panda, T1R1 Human, T1R1 Mouse, T1R1 Rat, T1R1 Dog, and T1R1 Cat uploaded to databases. Gene sequences were found in the Uniprot database (https://www.uniprot.org/). For 3D protein structure of T1R1 Panda, T1R1 Human, T1R1 Mouse, and T1R1 Rat are found in RCSB PDB database (https://www.rcsb.org/).
